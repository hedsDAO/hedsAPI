						unprecedented audio-visual experience. By sheer power of will & dedication to publishing forward-thinking art, we
						released the hedsTAPE 01 contract onto ETH mainnet. This set into motion a pattern of monthly curation cycles. With
						each cycle, weâ€™re testing the boundaries of what it means to create a collaborative art piece.`}
